### Career Break (August 2021 - Present)
After spending 7 years in 4 different startups, I realized what I am not working on does not excite me. Having figured out that I would like to build my career in Computer Vision, I decided to stop working for a while, upskill, and find the kind of work where I don't require external motivation to deliver.

After spending a couple of months with family and friends, and having devoured a bunch of books, I started by brushing up on Python in the month of Jan. After that, I worked through the basics of ML and CNNs. Post that, I worked on different algorithms in order to build an acceptable level of proficiency in the field.

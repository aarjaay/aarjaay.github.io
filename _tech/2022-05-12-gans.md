Q. Why 1 - D(G(z)) ? 
	- That's because this transformation points the desires of the discriminator and Generator in consistent directions between the two terms in the equation. 
	- The discriminator wants to maximise the entire function, the generator wants to minimise the entire function.



- first term is the expectation of the log of the output of the discriminator when the input is from real data distribution.

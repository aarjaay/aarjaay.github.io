##### Story so far
I started looking into [Pointnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) from Monday, June 27. Before that, I had some understanding of Pointnet - had looked into a blog, read the paper once or twice. But I was not confident. I was afraid that I have already looked into an online repository which has implemented this, and now whenever I'll reproduce the algorithm, my implementation would be *influenced*. I was afraid that having read a blog already, my reading of the paper is not authentic; and hence I won't be able to *measure* myself on 'paper reading' ability. <br><br>These, however, are just some insecurities I was dealing with. Another thought which was causing me pain was that of approaching the deadline of getting on a payroll by the end of June. I knew I need some more time in order to prepare myself to apply to the companies I want to work at.<br><br>I later realized that I was going through a burn-out phase, which is puzzling given that I am on a career break right now. I did not understand my state then, but over the next 9 days when I detached myself from this race, I realised slowly that I had a lot of built-up negative emotions inside, almost all stemming from the idea of reaching to the *destination* (read get a job) as soon as possible. It was June 19th, when I decided to stop focusing on work for a while.

#### Motivation
After reading the paper a couple of times now, after going into some rabbit holes to understand the what(s) and the why(s), after taking a sneak peak upon finding myself in a dark zone, I am ready to start coding now. I also want to write a blog on Pointnet (and later on Pointnet++). But I didn't want to write a blog after writing the code - I believe there would be a lot of things I would unearth and understand while coding, and it's a good idea to document them. <br>Further, the coding blogs I have read are not up to the mark - they are very bland, I have not been able to connect with them. I have found them to follow a top-down approach. I on the other hand believe firmly in a primarily bottom-up approach, with some times partially going top-down to understand better the concepts. Hence, I wanted to write a blog in such a way as to ensure if someone were to read this, they would understand. <br>And lastly, blogging while coding will force me to take a step back and think so as to explain the code in simple English, which I think will make me write better code. Hence, after coding a significant chunk of logic, I'll take a step back and try to explain what's being done here with all the commits, code, and other relevant info/links.

## Region Proposal Network

RPN or Region Proposal Network was first introduced as a part of Faster R-CNN architecture. The main objective of RPN network is to propose regions which might have object(s) that needs to be detected.

### Architecture
<br>

![RPN Architecture](/assets/imgs/rpn_archi.png "Credits: Code With Aarohi") <br>
<br>
In the image above, the block in dotted square represents a RPN network.
<br> <br>
The input image is fed to a convnet which serves as the backbone of RPN. The authors of [Faster R-CNN paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf) paper used VGG16. However, it is the prerogative of the programmer to use any convnet they want to use. It should be noted that in Faster R-CNN, only the convolutional layers of VGG16 were used, i.e. the Fully Connected layers were removed while using the network as a part of RPN. <br> <br>
The output of the convnet is fed to two different convolutional neural networks, both serving different purposes:

1. One network is a 1x1x(9*2) conv layer. This serves as a classifier network, i.e. it tells whether the region has an object or not.
2. Another network is 1x1x(9*4) conv layer. This is a regressor network - it predicts the offsets for 4 values of the bounding box. The 4 values are x, y, w, and h. 

### How does the RPN work ?
The convnet helps in extracting feature from the image.


TODO <br>
1. Role of anchors ? 
2. Foreground and Background
3. Why 9*2 ?
4. IoU at which stage ? 
5. 

### Training RPN

### Why RPN ?

### How is this different from YOLO ?

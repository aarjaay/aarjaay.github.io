[Motivation for this blog](#motivation)


#### Motivation
I have been away from regular coding for almost 4 years now. Owing to this huge gap, I found it difficult starting again even after reading someone elses's code. Hence, for for next 4 weeks (i.e. until March 21), I'll be reading various code-bases and try solving the said problems by myself. During this time, if I hit a road-block, I'll be going back to the code-base and understand how exactly the author went around that particular problem.

While going through one of such online repos, I also realized going into rabbit holes is a must in order to understand what exactly is happening. I have decided to start takings *notes* during such rabbit holes. This will help me retain the knowledge and also make myself more accountable.

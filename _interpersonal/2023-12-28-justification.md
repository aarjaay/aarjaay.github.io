Back in December 2020, a dear friend of mine started a tradition of hosting yearly awards ceremony amongst us friends - there are some categories on which voting happens and the highest voted person gets that award. It's a wonderful tradition that we are proud and happy about. Among others, one great thing about this forum is that we allow each other to be vulnerable, we talk about our fears. In one previous edition, we spent 10-15 mins discussing how baldness has affected self-confidence amongst people. The examples sounds funny to me, but it also is a shining example of the freedome we give ourselves and each other - *small* things have *big* impact. Yesterday was the fourth edition of CARE (Chalante Awards for Relative Excellence, Chalante being the name of our group :smirk:). And that is the trigger for this post, though the thought of writing these thoughts has captured my mind for a long time. <br>

I am someone who thinks a lot and deeply - sometimes this causes problems (I end up in an action paralysis state), sometimes this gives me a significant clarity of thought. The former has happened more though, and there are reasons for that which I hope I'll cover in this post. <br>
After making the decision of quitting my job, I have had more mental bandwidth in the recent past. Deep reflections, letting go self-imposed mental burdens and obligations, and seeking help enabled me to understand that the opinion others will have has a huge impact on the decisions I make on a daily basis - short-term and long-term both. What others think about me is a variable I always consider when deciding anything, and the weight given to this variable is very high. Generally, these are those people who are doing better than me professionally, they come from premium institutions, they work at Big companies with a proven track record - this is the sole metric ~~we~~ I have learned to define success. <br>


In every meeting, we have this section where each person reflects on their year - it serves as a group update given that everyone doesn't know everything about others; regular nxn updates gets affected in bigger groups, specially when boys become men :relieved:, and time is scarce. <br>
When the section started yesterday, I was feeling positive and was looking forward to my turn - 365 days are lot many days, and I had at least one major life update. But as I saw all 7 speak one after another, my enthusiasm went down. It happened because I saw every person speaking about their experiences, choices made with a kind of confidence which I was not feeling this particular evening. I was wary if what I say will resonate with these people, will my thoughts make sense; will the decision be received with enthusiasm and support, or it'll be looked at with skepticism, specially given that this is going to be my 3rd career break in ~4 years. This transition from high to low is a typical example of how deeper fears play out at surface level - how my mental state changes from ecstatic to that of despondency in a matter of minutes. <br>

Quitting is a risk I am taking, while my training in life has been to take the safe path always. Conversation with my manager around leaving the org took place on Dec 14 and I felt extremely relieved, light as feather when we decided my last working day would be Jan 31st. However, I went into self-doubt spiral in the following days. I am taking a hit at multiple levels
1. Financial Hit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. I am leaving at a time when my appraisal is due in 3/4 months. The facts that I didn't negotiate when I was getting hired (I was coming from a break and the tech industry was starting at a correction), and having done well in the past few months on a new responsibility I took in July, I am/was expecting a significant raise. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Apart from loss of incoming savings monthly, I'll be burning savings (I don't intend to find a job straightaway).
2. It's not a high-pressure job and the way we work, I have ample time on my hands after carrying out my daily responsibilities. I can manage (at least on paper) 2-3 hours of personal work daily with a relaxed, flexible routine. I can (again, on paper) manage preparing for the next job while working on the current one easily. 
3. This will lead to another career break on my resume, and though these phases are finding acceptance in professional life, it's still something you have to convince your prospective employer.
4. And most importantly, **people's perception**, *log kya kahenge*. 

If I am to ask any *rational* person and give then the above data points before letting them make an opinion, s/he will ask me to at least wait till appraisal and then resign. It's stupid to do otherwise.

Reflecting on my thoughts gave me a glimpse of these fears/concerns and I spent reasonable time analysing the arguments and counter-arguments my mind produced. I started noting down what's causing my anxieties and started asking relevant and hard/difficult questions to tell myself why this was the only option I had, the only way to come out of the Chakravyuh I find myself in. When I started scribbling down my thoughts, I also had a very strong desire to structure them and publish them - either on my blog or in my personal journal. <br>
I am choosing the former, primarily because I think (and have heard various people say) that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. The more we are closed, the more control we cede to fear. I am not going to keep this a secret to be shared with a select few, if at all. I'll lay my fears bare to see them in broad daylight, I'll throw down the gauntlet and not surrender.<br><br>


So the question is why do I need a breather, why can't I hop on to the next one if I am unhappy here or not aligned with the company. Let me first address all 4 concerns mentioned above and then add a few more reasons why this is necessary:
1. Why this *irrational* step ?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. I know that money and having a dependable career trajectory are important, not only important, I **want** a handsome salary, I **want** a respectable position in the company I work at. However, these should not come at a cost of constant pain (of any kind), few prerequisites have to be met before I move to these. It's something like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs - you don't care for psychological/self-fulfillment needs unless you have the basic needs met.  there are few appraisal question - rat race, what are you optimising. If you are not happy on a daily basis, if you cringe at the thought of going through the daily routine when you wake up, then there is something fundamentally wrong with how you are living your life. Money is not the variable I want to optimise for right now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. I suffer from a Hyper Responsibility Syndrome. I am not sure if that's a medical term, nor has any licensed professional given me this label. What I mean by the above is I am someone who is very righteous, to an extent where it has started affecting me negatively. Though my work doesn't require my full-time presence and I can log off for 2-3 hours after setting up the house in order, and then log off for another after doing a health-check in the middle of the day; I feel obliged to be available for the entire time. Given that I manage a team of ~12 people plus I am the face of the team, I feel I am ethically supposed to make sure the machinery doesn't come to a halt because of my absence. What instagram and facebook does to people, Slack does to me - I am constantly checking for messages. This led to being in a constant alert state without any alarms being raised. I tried few times to work on personal projects side by side, but I couldn't handle 2 orthogonal endeavours simultaneously.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. As long I have a story to tell and am honest, I think I'll be able to convince prospective employer. Good people and companies look out for passionate folks to work with, people who are open to take risks and fail. Eventually, it'll boil down to finding the best fit. Worst case scenario, I'll have to start at a position which is junior to my current one. If it comes to that, I am willing to pay that price, but not the current one. Also, it's a problem I'll deal with when it surfaces.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Log to hamesha kuch na kuch kahenge hi. Majority of my decisions (unknowingly) have been driven by how they will affect my social standing. I want to follow my heart this time, not my mind. In my heart, I know this is the best path for me.
2. I have had the good fortune of being around smart people since at least 9th Grade - 2 decades now. In the group of 8 people above (Chalante), 5 went to one or the other IIT (I wasn't one of them), another did his second graduation from UCSF and the last is on a fast promo track (if I remember correctly, second time) working for a huge govt organization. I was surrounded by high-achievers during 6 early years of my career - both at flat and in office, crème de la crème of their JEE years. It has been a blessing, but it has also been a curse. Eager to impress them and be a part of the coveted club, I mistook their priorities as gold, adopted their personality while suppressing mine. I was never competitive, I became obsessed with being better everyday, I started chasing goals like never before. And when I couldn't move forward, I stressed about not achieving them, constantly thinking about the "lost opportunity". I stifled myself so that when others see me, they see a reflection of themselves and like me. <br>
I stopped living with these people and came home during Covid, but I brought these personality traits with me, they were like slime clinging to my personality. I left these people in 3D space, they were always judging me in my mental space. It was not their fault, I am not shedding a negative light on these people - a lot of them are very good friends, for life. There was a vaccum inside which got filled, had it not been these people, there would have been others - same qualities or different we'll never know. <br>
So these characteristics defined how I think, how I spent every second. In professional setting I was always running at full throttle, for I was trained (and consistently fed myself relevant content) in hustle culture. I stopped enjoying work on a daily basis and always thought about the goals to be achieved, mountains to be climbed. The fact that boundaries between private and personal life were blurred didn't help, it only added fuel to the fire. With porous boundaries, this fire found it's way home as well - I started listening podcasts instead of music, while chosing a book to read I thought how it is going to help me get better, I can't watch sticoms coz I think it's a waste of time. In short, I have been on an optimization spree and in that spree, the joy of learning a craft got lost.<br>
With that mental pattern, whenever I tried working on changing my career track (yes, I did try to multi-task), I couldn't sustain. Anxiety got better of me every single time (because getting there fastest way possible was always my goal). It felt like standing in the middle of circular room with few doors, each door signifying one aspiration. A huge grandfather clock's ticking sound amplified in my mind - tick tock, tick tock, time is running out; I must act soon because I have to checkmark all these boxes. And the moment I took a step or two towards any of the doors, the importance of other doors magnified, the chosen door's diminished. Back to centre, evaluating which door to pick. Tick tock, tick tock, time is running out and I must act soon. Every iteration ended with me burning out and taking few days off completely, going all binge (which lead to a guilt cycle). This cycle repeated so many times that I started identifying with and anticipating various spokes of the wheel. <br>
You know what is stupid and irrational ? Expecting me to function properly and move forward when I am carrying so much baggage on my shoulders. When I put all the above things in perspective, I realise I don't care if people expect me to run while juggling 3 balls in my hands, when I can't even walk properly. The throns on the path trouble me, no one else see them in the first place. I need to get a broom to clear my path and weave boots which protect me from future gaps before I start walking again. I have to learn to control the narrative, change my thinking pattern. I have to discard a lot of harmful habits that eat me away like termites and build new ones(I hope I'll write about these in coming months). I have to (and want to) be driven by [love, not fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su6urM6Li5k). <br>
3. There is a huge value in being excited about what one is working on, a value which cannot be measured, but is significant nonetheless. Decisions governed by the idea of pleasing others instead of personal satisfaction/happiness at a fundamental level has been a cause of chronic dissatisfaction and underlying feeling of gloom. Additionally, I don't look forward to the problem statement my current employer org is targeting. The way things are being done is also different than the way I want things to move. When I get up every morning and mentally think about the day, I feel all positive energy sapped out from me - as if air is deflated from a ballon. <br>
I want to be involved, I want excitement to be a recurring theme everyday. I don't want to be in a optimization rut because there are so many things to work on and so little time. It'll be a better way of spending every day if I have reasons to continue work after working hours rather than waiting for the clock to strike 5. I want to put myself in a place where I can get in the *flow* state - something that I have been in multiple times. And to ensure such a day sounds like everyday for the most of my remaining life, I need to put in efforts and structure my life that way.
4. Most importantly, this is the way I want to solve this problem, this path is what I think and **believe** is the best path for me. I have tried the other, and have implemented various approaches to make it work under that umbrella. None worked for me, empirical data suggests that path is not working for me. All I have left is the first idea I came up with. ["This is what I believe, and I am willing to die for it. Period."](https://youtu.be/cFYG-G-_ico?si=NPRu_v3Ls0ZNaDRh&t=1018) <br>


There are lot more thoughts that I want to capture. But this essay is get too long and I don't have the energy to continue further in this one. Also, the ideas I have to express are conceptually different from the theme of this one. I'll cover them in successive essays.<br><br>


As I mentioned earlier above, the idea of compiling all above neatly was an idea I had few days back. I wanted to write and organize my thoughts in order to tell myself that the reasons I am making this choice are valid, and I don't have any other option if I want get out of this vicious cycle. But when one decides with [The Road Not Taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#/media/File:RoadAtlantic.jpg), and all the people one respects and loves don't agree with, one feels scared. I was scared and wanted to justify myself in face of the volley of questions and disapproval I am going to get from the world. I realise what started as a justification letter turned out be a Love Letter from me to me. :heart:

It's been a while since I wrote here - either in (Inter)Personal or in Tech. I started exploring job opportunities somehwere in the month of June. However, I didn't succeed. A lot of reasons kept me from achieving my objective - shifting goal post, i.e. lack of focus the most prominent one. This could be expanded to a number of dimensions, but that's beside the point.<br><br>
Having observed the response from recruiters and looked at their feedback (both explicit and implicit), I realised that I need to work more in two areas - System Design, and hands-on coding. Both the endeavours have slightly different end-goals. But both the goals are inter-linked significantly, and for the time, I'd rather continue focusing on both.<br><br>
Moving forward, I intend to code at least 5 days a week for the next 4-5 weeks, and author a blog similar number of days. The goal of these daily blogs would be to write what I learned the previous day - both with respect to the code I wrote, and the System Design problem I worked upon. This will help me stay focused and regular; it'll also help me build something which I can showcase.<br><br>
To begin with, I started a new project yesterday - People Detection and Tracking. The idea is to identify people and track them as the same time - give a unique id to the person and track if this person is inside the video or not. This is a relatively simple project using OpenCV and a pretrained Yolov3 model, not involving any actual Machine Learning. <br>
Tomorrow, I will write about what I learned while coding yesterday and today; and hopefully also about how to design a System for Tinder application. I'll be attempting this Sys Des problem first, and then move on to watching Gaurav Sen's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tndzLznxq40) on the same problem, that'll help me evaluate my work.

June 04, 2022

Past 2-3 days have been pretty tough. June 01 went by fine, but towards the end, I could sense a negative feeling brewing somewhere. In hindsight, I know that it came from trying to squeeze in a bit more of work than I had bandwidth of. This mental pressure which I imposed on myself triggered a routine in which I end up trying to optimize all the variables, going through mental calculations almost every minute.<br>
The routine I mentioned above look like this: I calculate the number of hours at hand, come up with the number of hours needed to complete given task(s), and when I realise that L.H.S > R.H.S., I do it again; trying to pilfer minutes so as to chart out a perfect schedule which will lead me to glorious victory. This ends up being a recursive loop which increases the self-imposed pressure on every iteration, takes away my focus from the desirable problems replacing them with self-sabotaging junk and makes me obsessed with quantity rather than quality.<br>
I don't realise that what I want is different from what is possible, never understand that this is a case of moving goalposts, always fail to understand that in order to have the extra, I will have to let go of something already inside the basket. <br> <br>
Going back to June 01, I could sense that feeling, but couldn't pin-point the source of the feeling. When the next day started, I was carrying the failure of the later half of the previous day, not the success achieved during the first 70% of the day. The continuous awareness of this particular failure activated another routine - the comparison routine. I started comparing myself with the people I want to call my equals. And then I started fixating on the amount of ground to cover. <br>
Apart from these unhealthy thoughts, I had some unavoidable distractions during the day. Due to various reasons, it was hard for me remain focused for a prolonged period. As a result, I couldn't achieve much during the day. By the end of the day, negative feelings were at riding the high tide. <br> <br>
Long story short, all of my yesterday and around 60% of today were wasted. I reached a place where I had to restart my system. I had to rest my mind and make a fresh start. 
I was trying to understand today what causes such failures, for I have witnessed similar failures in the past as well. There were a couple of reasons I could point to:

1. Greed, the tendency to over-optimise, the need to reach the heights as soon as possible without understanding the time it takes to reach there.
2. Haste, a child of greed.
3. Taking things too seriously, specially when not required.
4. Collapse of non-porous boundaries between work and life.
5. Willing to compromising quality for quantity.
6. Thinking of work as a chore, a task to be done; not to be enjoyed.

Though I am working on all of the above; #1, #2, and #5 are the most visible today. These are the specious goals some of us learn to pursue during our training. I think of them as deeply ingrained mental habits, and it is taking time more than anciticipated to evict them. While I have become better at dealing with them, they are still able to fool me at times. <br><br> 
Moving forward, from tomorrow, I am hoping to focus only and only on number of Pomodoro(s) I complete during a day. That would be one metric of success when it comes to measuring my produce on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. Of course, this can not be the single source of reference when it would come to my professional life. Finding the right balance is necessary. But, right now, I need to overpower these habits.

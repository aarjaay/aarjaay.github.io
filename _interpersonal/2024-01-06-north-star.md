&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Saturday, the first week of 2024 is about to end. By the end of January, this novelty around weekends will be lost, and I'll not worry so much about having flawless weeks. I'll find more days for a fresh start - first day of the 3 quarters, I'll divide the year into trimesters when the months of April and August will not go as planned, second half of the year, and few others dates which have some significance. Slowly and steadily, the year will be gone and I'll be staring at first weekend of 2025, subtly remembering the lost opportunities of 2024, but all optimistic about the coming year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least that's what has happened for so many years, I have ~~tried~~, ~~strived~~ wanted a lot to have the kind of years which could be archived as perfect examples of how to execute a plan. This thinking pattern has expanded over study schedules/plans, daily routines. I plan very meticulously, come up with very elaborate and *well thought* plans which promise efficiency of the highest level. In all plans the underlying narrative is same at an abstract level - looking/wanting a perfect, pretty picture.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few characteristics of what perfections means to me:
1. **Efficient** - flawlessly optimised days/weeks/months, no wastage of time. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This translates to having a known linear path towards my pursuit, any divergence feels like a failure.
2. **Bottom Up** - knowledge of the basics before understanding higher level concepts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This translates to a desire of chasing rabbit holes and signing up for courses which are good to have, but not mandatory - a superficial knowledge is enough to solve the problem at hand.<br>
3. **Greatness** - I want to learn from the greats, be a great, do great work. Greatness has many definitions, those in my dictionary are virtuoso in a given field, having a huge impact on the lives of others (social standing).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am busy finding the right combination between these three levers to produce melody, another factor comes into play - time. I don't have unlimited time. And once in a while when I look back at how much did I progress, I realize the progress hasn't been a lot when it comes to achieving the basic things in life - we are back to Maslow's Law. I can enter a rabbit hole and never come out of it, but then I also need a castle on the ground where I can go and look at the sun setting once in a while. (Greed has a role to play here, but I am not elaborating on that right now). The insecurity kicks in and then I end up in the optimisation loop.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here I am to decide and document the tenets of this third iteration. I was in a very different mental state during first two breaks. I can plan and strategise better - accounting for other variables which do not look important to me prima facie but are important nonetheless. Of the so many shining stars in the sky, I have to identify which is my north star.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent the week trying to complete some lectures of a course I have signed up for. I was trying very hard to not fail - it was the first week of the year and I wanted to write a perfect week will which pave the way for perfect months and then a perfect year. Perfect here means efficient - no wastage of time (on a daily basis) and also a known linear path which leads to no wastage of time in the longer run. There's another facet to the perfection obsession - the idea that I need to understand evertyhing, the idea that my knowledge should be built bottom-up. That's the reason I signed up for that course in the first place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have this obsession of documenting everything. I am a hoarder - my progress in life is documented in my journals safely stored in a carton, I have saved all the chats and messages from years back - something I don't think I'll ever go to again. Given that career pursuits are a very important to me (sadly, career is the biggest factor in defining personal identity), it's obvious that I wanted to document my progress on this front.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one more obession, a by-product of perfection obsession perhaps - I plan a lot. My earliest memories are of creating time-tables without any breathing space between two slots. I remember this one time when I was in college and I planned the entire decade. These have proved to be wishful thinking at the best.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with all this context, I spent the week trying to complete few lecturs of a course I have signed up for. Starting of a year, starting of a break --> these 2 were strong motivations to start a blog series which would document all that happened over the past week - 52 blogs for 52 weeks was my intention. Mind you, the weeks and months had to be perfect.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the week didn't go as planned - something that happens always. So I went to a cafe and, guess what, did more planning. Created time-tables which I would follow for few months and the belief that everything will be sorted. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good thing that happened this time was that after a point, I got overwhelmed. There is so much to do, and no matter how much I tried, I couldn't fit in everything. Something or the other kept on being left behind. Time is a resource I don't have unlimited supply of. Which means I have to let go of few things. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have of course stumbled upon this great reckoning multiple time previously. What's different this time ? I don't know. Maybe the different is time. I am in a better mental state than before. I am choosing love over fear this time. I am making a choice this time, and though I did make choice the last time as well, those I'll make will be more informed. What's important is that I am not giving up and trying again. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what next ? I made few decisions and (surprise surprise) a plan while sitting in the cafe yesterday. I have to let go of few personality traits, change few more. This is akin to habit change which will be painful and time-taking. Also, it'll not happen on Day 01 - what I need to have is patience and belief. <br>

**Plan**:<br>
- **Jan-Feb** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- LeetCode during evening hours (post office) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tangential Reading during office hours (while not working) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 30 minutes on relevant Maths courses (before evening run/workout) <br>
- **Mar-Jun** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2 hours of tangential reading <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 6 hours of daily coding (includes thinking/understanding/relevant concepts) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Habit/Mindset Change**:<br>
- Surfacial understanding --> Implementation --> Rabbit Hole<br>
- 3 short term valuable projects followed by a week of wandering<br>
- On your own terms, but get stable first - have a solid base (financially and knowledge)
- Dissociate your identity from career //career is a part of your identity
- Live the life today (to some extent) that you want to live in the future
- Find time for joy

17. Why does this still feel forced ? Why is there no joy here ?
    - evth can't be measured or looked through the lens of optimization
    - what do I want ? 
        - tangential reading
        - lectures/courses 
            - ther are so many, the moment they are paced, I feel I won't be able to complete them
            - do I need to complete them ? If yes, how many of these do I need to complete ? 
            - Why do I need to complete ? 
        - can I work smartly ? learn in a unstructured manner instead of the age-old structured manner ?
        - Is it necessary to be a purist ?
        - I need not know how does 1+1 equal to 2

        - Rabbit Hole is fine, but then you have to choose which rabbit hole. Don't you think Tangential Readings are a foray into rabbit holes ? Also, you can't will rabbit holes - you'll have to give them the time and opportunity. 

        - We need to compartmentalize these 2 aspects of life:
            1. Career
            2. Self
        - the above is somewhere coming from the mixing the two - your identity is very much related to work and career.

        - start living the life today that you want to live in the future
        -

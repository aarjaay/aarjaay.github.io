For some unknown reason, I have always wanted to do things the perfect way. For example, when trying to learn a concept, I am one of those people who'll want to learn all the underlying concepts before moving forward.


I am just little more than a month away from executing a decision which is going to raise eyebrows from many people. Some of them will shrug off and carry with their lives, others will worry about my acumen. I don't blame them, in fact when I think deeply, I am thankful for they wish well for me.<br>

Come February 01, I'll be unemployed again. This is going to be my third career break. I am someone who hasn't been able to multi-task. But at the root of this characteristic is that I haven't been able to find a balance. I am a greedy person - I want things as soon as possible, and I want more of a lot of things without asking whether I really need them. I am always worrying about what next instead of allowing myself to live in the present. This is a fundamental trait which I need to change; which I found myself incapable of changing while answerable to someone else - my boss and the company I was employed too. Of course, I didn't like the problem statement as well.<br>

Now that I'll have at least 4-6 months at my disposal when I will be able to spend my time the way I want to, I was thinking what would be my goals ? If I just focus on one goal - getting better at Computer Science, then I know I'll fall in the same pit I am in right now. I need to stop thinking of goals and start thinking in terms of systems. <br>
I am confident that I can spend 2 hours daily on educating myself in the month of January. That's one system I am going to invest in heavily over the next one month - spend 2 hours in the evening (7-9) on what I learned. That'll also include writing a brief for 10 minutes what I learned. Apart from this, if I get one hour of time during office hours, that'll be an added bonus. I won't stress about it.<br>

Apart from the above, following systems need to be created:
1. At least 5 days of strength and cardio training.
2. Regular Meditation practice - I attended a 10 day Vipassana course in 2017, hoping to attend another in Feb '24.
3. 2 hours of "no work" time - read, music, socialize. Anything which is not work. //This system can be removed/altered after some time.
4. Learn something new - which isn't work. I have a casio SA 21, I will fetch that from store.
5. Gratitude Journal
6. Digital Detox post 8 PM
7. 20-minute walk at the night without phone.


This is enough to begin with. I need to start keeping a tracker of these things.

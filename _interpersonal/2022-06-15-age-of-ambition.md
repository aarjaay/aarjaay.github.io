title: "Age of Ambition"

One of the things I learned during my 4 year stint as Elucidata was how to dream big, how have large ambitions. Before that, I was mesmerized by great things and envied people who achieved such milestones, but never had the vision that achieving a similar fate is something I can pursue as well.<br><br>
During the early part of this career break, one of the co-founders of Deepen.ai reached out to me for a TPM role. The reason I decided to take this break was that I wanted to get out Program Management vertical, hence I had to decline the offer. But the work this company did caught my attention. <br><br>I have been going back to the website of this comapny once in a while during the middle of the break - just checking in what stuff they are doing, etc. It was like window shopping an article one wants to buy but doesn't have the means to buy it.<br>
Now that I am looking for jobs, this is one of the few companies I would want to work at. The primary reason I am attracted towards this company is the kind of work they do. It's a complex problem that they are trying to solve and that's the kind of stuff I have found myself drawn towards - complex, difficult, esoteric. But I am not prepared right now for the company - or so I think. They work primarily in 3D domain and my limited experience has been in 2D. <br><br>In order to bridge this gap, I have decided to update my goals. Now, I'll pick up some research papers which are aligned with the kind of work Deepen is doing - 3D segmentation, 3D bounding box, etc. And in order to align my earlier goal of having an offer by the month end, I have decided to go for 3-4 research papers during the upcoming 16 days, one paper corresponding to one line of work at Deepen. Or maybe 4 research papers in the same line of work - that's a detail I'll figure out after completing one project.<br><br>Another experience I have gained during my 7 years of start-up experience is that rushing towards an ambitious goals help us achieve more than we could have achieved otherwise. This goal of reproducing 4 research papers is very aggressive - 2 papers I am comfortable with, third will be a bit tricky. I am not at all sure how the fourth will look like. <br>This goal, however, serves another purpose - a kind of alignment in my mindset. The 50 odd things I do during the entire day should have one single point of focus - somehow get to reproducing 4 research papers while not comprimising on the quality. That's the kind of focus I need in my life to steer myself through the sea of distractions.

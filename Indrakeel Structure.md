Blog:
01. Rabbit Hole
    - to what extent ?

    - NeRF
    - 3D Recon
    - SLAM
    - Text to Video
    - Karpathy
    - two way: 
        read whatâ€™s happening at the frontier of science and tech
            ICCV
            NeurIPS
        Continue learning stuff for the short-term
03. Hoarder
    - the attraction of the best //karpathy
    - perfection
        - start from the top
04. Code
05. Structure, but very subtle

07. Interests ? 
    - Surgery
    - Cognitive //AGI
    - Robotics
    - Drones

15. Slow and steady - 2 decade long horizon
    - Kobe Bryant method
16. Courses vs Lectures
    - course every Saturday
    - 3 papers, and then one course
17. Why does this still feel forced ? Why is there no joy here ?
    - evth can't be measured or looked through the lens of optimization
    - what do I want ? 
        - tangential reading
        - lectures/courses 
            - ther are so many, the moment they are paced, I feel I won't be able to complete them
            - do I need to complete them ? If yes, how many of these do I need to complete ? 
            - Why do I need to complete ? 
        - can I work smartly ? learn in a unstructured manner instead of the age-old structured manner ?
        - Is it necessary to be a purist ?
        - I need not know how does 1+1 equal to 2

        - Rabbit Hole is fine, but then you have to choose which rabbit hole. Don't you think Tangential Readings are a foray into rabbit holes ? Also, you can't will rabbit holes - you'll have to give them the time and opportunity. 

        - We need to compartmentalize these 2 aspects of life:
            1. Career
            2. Self
        - the above is somewhere coming from the mixing the two - your identity is very much related to work and career.

        - start living the life today that you want to live in the future
        -

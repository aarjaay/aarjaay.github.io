Your heart is bleeding, a wound just opened up. You didn't know it existed, you don't know what it is about, where it is from. You can feel it, yet you cannot see it. It's there, beyond your reach. You can't touch it or grope about using your hands. You light a candle and cast about for the bruise's existence. You don't see anything beyond the area the candle illuminates. <br>You wonder if there's anything beyond the darkness. You try to find a way, but you don't see a path. The candle fails you, it is unable to illuminate anything beyond its sphere of influence. You are tired and completely clueless. You give up the effort and return to life.

  

You feel the tug again. Now, you look for comfort. You engage in conversations, you message those you haven't talked to for a while. Your defence mechanism kicks in, you mould your words diferently and make them laugh. You tell them that it's late and you'd like to retire. You listen to songs, foraging the lyrics you haven't heard for a long time. You find a song that touches your heart. It's in a language you don't understand completely. The singer's voice melts your soul. You want to sing along, the music player enables that. Not soaking in the meaning, however, makes you flutter away.

  

You flip pages of books you have read earlier and go back to the sections you have highlighted. You instantly connect to the characters whose lives you lived with them. You understand their pain, you cry for their loss. It's puts a balm on the lesion, but still, it's there. You switch to movies, watch again the most moving scenes you have seen. They are convincing, but the lack of build-up ruins the comfort you could have received.

You are rummaging around, seeking something profound, something of essence. What, you don't know. You have been seeking that in lyrics, novels, dialogues. Maybe it's the other way round. Words have been seeking you.

He stepped out of the house after a long time. Well, not technically. He had been visiting his friends twice or thrice in a week. But stepping out like this: a solo visit to a cafe had become a rarity. The Corona virus had restricted his outings manifold. Today, however, he couldn’t contain himself. The restlessness building over the past two days had reached its climax today, and running away from it any longer would have proved detrimental to his focus for the next week.

It had been a while since he arrived at this cafe. He had been able to secure his favourite spot, a seat overlooking the not so busy road below. Gazing over the horizon, he could see various high profile buildings across the road. This was one of the happening parts of his city. He had been fervently typing away on his laptop for the better part of last 30 minutes and was taking a short chai break. He was missing the feel of a cigarette on his fingers, the combination of sutta and chai helped him gather his thoughts.

Pushing his toes below on the ground, he had been able to balance his chair on its hind legs with its front two legs in air.yeThis simple adjustment had enabled him to create a makeshift swing on which he was oscillating up and down. Observing the handful of people on the road below with his chair dancing on his toes, he was contemplating the direction of the article he had been working on when he heard someone call out his name. Moving his head to register the source of the voice, he was taken by surprise. His chair came crashing down with a thud on the floor, earning some stares from the people sitting on the adjoining tables. But it didn’t matter, he was very much taken aback by this sudden appearance to take note of the transient attention he gathered.

    
<span style="color:blue">“Wow !! It is really you !”</span> she said.




<span style="color:green">“Hi !! Yes, it is me. What a pleasant surprise. I must say, you haven’t changed a bit.”</span>, he said getting up and stretching his hand for a handshake. She indeed hadn’t changed a bit. The same bun resting on the top of her head, same brown eyes, and same beaming face. It was as if she hadn’t aged at all in the last 8 years since he saw her last. 

    

<span style="color:blue">“Haha, thanks. But you have changed a lot. Look at you, you are sporting a small pony these days. And you have also lost so much weight.”</span>, she exclaimed while taking his hand. Her long slim fingers clasped around his palm and they exchanged a weak handshake.



He could just smile, unable to even thank her for the compliment. His mind had drawn a complete blank, he was finding it difficult to think straight. <span style="color:green">“Wow, this is completely unexpected. I hadn’t imagined stumbling upon you like this.” </span>This was a lie. The thought of meeting her like this had crossed his mind almost every time when he had gone out during his visits to his hometown. 



<span style="color:blue">“Yet here we are. Tell me, who have you been waiting for ? Are you out on a date or what ?”</span>, she teased. He could see her mischievous smile hidden somewhere. 



<span style="color:green">“Haha, no re. Just finishing some work.”</span>, he said, pointing at his laptop sheepishly. Fumbling he added,<span style="color:green"> “Err, why .. why don’t you sit ? Should I order a chai for you ? I .. I  was just about to order one more for me.”</span> He said that just to make small talk.



<span style="color:blue">“I wish, but I can’t.”</span> looking over his shoulder towards the exit gate she held up her index and middle finger, mouthing the words, <span style="color:blue">‘2 minutes’.</span> When he turned his face, he could see a man standing with a little boy looking towards them with a quizzical expression on his face. <span style="color:blue">“My husband and my son are waiting for me. We are already running late.”</span>



<span style="color:green">“Aah, I see. I didn’t know you have a son. Congrats. How old is he ?”</span>



<span style="color:blue">“Just about to turn 4 in a couple of months. But where have you been? I haven’t heard about you since college.”</span>



He was just about to answer when the little one called out, <span style="color:orange">“Mumma, chaloo.”</span>



Looking towards her son, she said <span style="color:blue">“Coming beta”</span>. Then she shifted her gaze back towards him and said, <span style="color:blue">“We should catch up some time. Here, take my number. Give me yours too.”</span> After exchanging the numbers, she bid him goodbye, and touching her bun, she walked towards her family. 



She left, but he found himself unsettled. He had thought about stumbling upon her like this multiple times, but the meeting wasn’t anything like he had thought. To be honest, he had never imagined what the meeting would look like. His imagination had stopped at just meeting her, it had never moved towards the kind of conversation they would have. Still, whatever transpired was nothing he would have imagined. 

Maybe because his idea of such an encounter was coloured by what was out there in the popular culture. The portrayal of such events was always coupled by some intense feelings, a deeper conversation, past memories flooding by which made the protagonist forget about the present, at least for a while. His expectation of such events had always been about one being bigger than life. But this hadn’t been such a moment. If he were to actually turn inwards and see what was going on his mind, he would have noticed this meeting was any other meeting with an old acquaintance. It didn’t matter so much. Just like his unfinished article, it was upon him to decide the further direction of his thoughts and feelings after this encounter.

ðŸ‘‹, I am Rajat Jain.

## Introduction

Hello there. My name is Rajat Jain. I started my professional journey in May 2014 and have worked in 4 startups since - ranging from a company size of 4 to a company size of 1,000 members.

I want to build my career in Computer Graphics and use Machine Learning as one of the tools to move forward in the industry.

I also have a [creative](/creatives) flair and tend to write small write-ups every now and then.

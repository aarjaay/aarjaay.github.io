Hi, I am Rajat Jain.

I started my professional journey in May 2014 and have worked at 4 startups since then - ranging from a company size of 4 to a company size of 1,000.

I want to build my career in Machine Learning. My primary concern is to acquire knowledge - of any kind.

I also have a [creative](/creatives) flair and tend to write small write-ups every now and then.

## Contact

My email addresses is [addresseerajat@gmail.com](mailto:addresseerajat@gmail.com). You can also reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajattjainn/).

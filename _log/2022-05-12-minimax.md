### Minimax Game 

Imagine 2 entities playing a turn-based game. Unlike popular games like football or basketball that have 2 set of scores - one for each entity, a minimax game has only one score - corresponding to the game. 

Suppose entity A wins the game if the score is more than a certain threshold, and entity B wins the game if the score is below a certain threshold. The threshold could mark a state when no entity wins the game.

In this setting, A will try to maximise the score, while B will try to minimize the score. This type of game is known as a minimax game.

## Updates:
**Jan 06:**
1. Agile Project Management
    - Four facets of Agile Manifesto:
        - Working software > Documentation
        - Interpesonal Collaboration > Process
        - Customer Satisfaction, collaboration > Negotiation Contracts
        - Continuous improvement in processes
    - 12 principles of Agile:
        - Grouped in 4 above buckets
        - Don't have them by heart, but the idea is to:
            1. delivery regularly, in small chunks
            2. be flexible to change
            3. work closely with the stakeholders --> customers, business
            4. talk and collaborate more with stakeholders instead of obsessing about tools and processes
            5. working quality software is more important than heavy documentation
            6. team should periodically reflect and improve processes, method of working
            7. take care of team-members --> motivated, happy people produce better work
            8. continuous focus on Technical excellence and good design lets you be more agile
2. Coding a Browser:
    - [Chapter 2 - Add graphics](https://github.com/aarjaay/browser/commit/baa9170de2899096d5f6afa1d0f45be4a54ff235)
        - Close and continuous interaction between program and OS to display and update text
        - `Tkinter` in python works as an abstraction layer for GUI
        - Use window and canvas to display text, scroll text, and optimise rendering
